# Lung-Cancer-Detection-Using-ML

## Lung Cancer Detection
This is a lung cancer detection system that uses machine learning algorithms to classify lung cancer based on medical images such as X-rays and CT scans. This system is designed to assist medical professionals in the early detection of lung cancer.

The system consists of two main components:

Data Preprocessing: This component is responsible for preprocessing the medical images before passing them to the machine learning model. It includes techniques such as image enhancement, normalization, and feature extraction.

Machine Learning Model: This component is responsible for classifying the preprocessed medical images into one of two categories: malignant or benign. The model is trained on a large dataset of medical images using supervised learning techniques.

## Requirements
Python 3.6 or later
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required packages using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main.py file to start the application.

## Usage
The system will display the classification result (malignant or benign) based on the machine learning model.

## Dataset
The lung cancer detection system was trained on the LIDC-IDRI dataset. This dataset consists of 1,018 CT scans of lung nodules with annotations by at least four radiologists.
