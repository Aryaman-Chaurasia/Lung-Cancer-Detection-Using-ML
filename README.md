# Lung-Cancer-Detection-Using-ML

## Lung Cancer Detection
This is a Lung Cancer Detection Project that uses Machine Learning Algorithms to classify Lung Cancer based on Clinical Data from a Kaggle Dataset. The dataset contains information on patients with Lung Cancer, including their Age, Gender, Smoking History, and other Medical Parameters. The system is trained on this dataset using Supervised Learning Techniques.

The system consists of two main components:

- Data Preprocessing: This component is responsible for preprocessing the clinical data before passing it to the machine learning model. It includes techniques such as Data Cleaning, Normalization, and Feature Extraction.

- Machine Learning Model: This component is responsible for classifying the preprocessed clinical data into one of two categories: Malignant or Benign. The model is trained on a large dataset of clinical data using supervised learning techniques.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or later
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required packages using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the code.py file to start the application.

## Usage
The system will display the result based on the machine learning model using various Graphs and Plots which help to understand the result in a simple and easy way .

## Dataset
The Lung Cancer Detection System was trained on the Lung Cancer dataset from Kaggle
